# OutlookForLinux

A JavaScript Electron app to use microsoft outlook like a desktop app on linux

How to get it.

Clone this Repository or download it onto your pc. Open a shell in the outlookforlinux directory and run the following command.

`npm install`
`npm run build`

Now there is a new 'dist' folder. in there you can find outlookforlinux-x.x.x.AppImage

Copy this file to a directory you like. now you can add a file link to your desktop or taskbar and start the app

## Important

Currently you can only use the Outlook Functionality. if you try to use word, excel or similar programms check my repositories for those programs.
